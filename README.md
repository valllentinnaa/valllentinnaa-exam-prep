# Exam Preparation

Problems for the exam preparation for the "Software Engineering and DevOps" course @ SoftUni.

You are given a simple Node.js application with failing tests. You should work in GitHub, fix the failing tests and deploy the app to Render.com.

## Resource Files
You are provided with a JS application â€“ download it from the resources for the exam preparation session.
You can test the application locally using the commands, described in the package.json file.
Don't forget to use npm install command.

### Working with Git and GitHub (25 points)
Create a New Repository in GitHub
Create a new repository in GitHub and upload the project files there. The repository should be named {your-softuni-username-exam-prep}.
Clone the Repository Locally
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Add, Commit and Push the Resource Files
Add the project resource files and commit them to the repository. Push the changes to the repo.
Create a Junior Developer Branch
In the local environment, navigate to the directory of the cloned project. Create a new branch and switch to it. The name of the branch should be junior-dev.
Fix the Failing Tests
After you have created the junior-dev branch, please refer to point 3. Fix Failing Tests. Once you have fixed the tests, proceed with the next steps.
Commit and Push Changes to New Branch
Without making any changes yet, push the junior-dev branch to GitHub.
Create Pull Request 
Now, go to GitHub and create a pull request to propose merging the junior-dev branch into the main branch. Finally, merge the two branches.
NOTE: Do not delete the junior dev branch. You can delete it or remove the entire repository AFTER you receive your exam grade!

### Fix Failing Tests (25 points)

You should implement a CI system in GitHub actions to build and unit test the application. 
Add a custom step to the build script in order to display your softuni username.

### Add UI Tests to CI (25 points)
Add the UI tests to your GitHub CI workflow.

### Implement CD (25 points)
Using the GitHub action script, implement a CD workflow to auto deploy the app in Render.com.
